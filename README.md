# Flutter Carousel with animation

Here i build a single page with a carousel where the showing one takes the 70% with of the screen and others inactive image take 50% of the size, so when we scroll it shows us a nice cool animation.
And the title of those screen goes down and their opacity goes to almost 1 to 0.3. I take help from youtube video.
